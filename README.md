This repository contains re-annotated vertebrae heights for 100 randomly selected 
images from the [MoscowRadiology-CTLungCa-500](https://mosmed.ai/en/datasets/mosmeddata-kt-s-priznakami-raka-legkogo-tip-viii/)
dataset. 

The annotation was first prepared for the paper [Keypoints Localization for Joint Vertebra Detection and Fracture Severity Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11960) 
and was used to train and evaluate the vertebrae fractures detection algorithm. However, the annotation was only focused on vertebrae from the thoracic region.

The version of the annotation in this repository contains the vertebrae from all regions and was prepared for the paper
[Interpretable vertebral fracture quantification via anchor-free landmarks localization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841522002742).

We urge the community to use the dataset and annotation in their research 
in order to be able to compare different methods for vertebrae fractures detection.

# Usage

`example.py` contains an example of matching the annotation with images from the dataset.

## Interpolation along curves

We also released the full code for interpolation along curves, used in our paper. 
It is available [here](https://github.com/neuro-ml/straighten).
